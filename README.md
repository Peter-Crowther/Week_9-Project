# Week_9-Project

THE BRIEF
The Goal; create a card game in Android.

MVP
Display the Java in Android, no or little interaction required.

Requires installation of Android Studio to play the game via an emulator, select the project, once loaded select run, then run app
from the menu bar.

Alernatively the code can be reviewed through your favourite code editor.

Experience from project;
I chose the card game as I wanted to challenge myself, other projects were similar to exercises we had performed during lessons or homeworks,
and I had previously found game logic to be a bit more tricky. What I found challenging was taking something so natural to me and converting it 
to work well through code. I tried to break everything down to it's core components and keep it as simple as possible so that dealer 
turns could be executed automatically and simply. The ace's high and low took a bit of thinking as how best to tackle and I'm very happy
with the simple solution used for that.

Using Android Studio was a bit new and took some trial and error with aligning buttons and screen orientation, but trial and error 
lead to results. 

I implemented a slight delay on the deal to make it easier to follow the game play, howeevr ran out of time on the project to implement 
across the whole of the turn. Future developments I hope to make to the app would be the addition of playing cards rather than the 
string of each card and some deal animations.
